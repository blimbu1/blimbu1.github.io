	<h1>Different Ways, Different Destination</h1>
	<p>I want to retire at 40. This was the predominantly strong thought that I had last week. In outward appearance I looked calm, collected and serene. Inside though I was aware of this cloudy, damp feeling/emotion that was gnawing inside of me, feeding off my happy spirit leaving only emptiness behind. This is still the predominant thought and desire currently in my head.</p>
	<p>Coming from a developing country,I understand the privilege that I am in. I have seen both sides of the coin. Here, I have been blessed with a good paying job and additionally the option/flexibility to choose where I would like to work and with whom I would like to work. For anyone who has had to earn a living(for surviving) or who are earning a living by working, we understand how important this is.</p>
	<p>Back in my birth country though, one of the biggest issues is unemployment. Scores of well bodied, able youth, unabile to earn, to cater to one's basic needs. Not being financially stable is enough to cause anyone low self esteem, low confidence and mental health issues more so in a country where government is unable to provide any form of living support.</p>
	<p>So when I say I want to retire at 40 doesn't mean I have an aversion to work. Again I have seen both sides of the coin. The pace of life in my birth country is slower. There is ample time to just sit down and relax. To be able to experience the different passing seasons and enjoy their own subtleties and uniquness. To be able to catch up with different people and build/restrengthen relationships. What I don't want is having my life <strong>blurr</strong> right through. To spend each passing day in the same room, 8 hours a day in front of screen, wishing for the weekend when I can have <em>some</em> free time. As much as I am <strong>extremely grateful</strong> for the amenities that a stable job provides for me, there is a strong desire for me to be financially independent. To prioritse experience.To feel and see different cultures and places. To priorities people and relationships. To prioritise life. </p>
