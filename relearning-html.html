    <h1>Relearning HTML and CSS for my project</h1>
    <p>Monday, 6th March 2023</p>
    <p>So after some consideration and deliberation I have decided to relearn or redo the lessons found <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. There are a few reasons that has led me to take this decision.</p>
    <p>Firstly it is the desire to start writing. I came across <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html" target="_blank">this</a>  article in HN(Hacker News) that explains clearly the benefits of writing. This has made me realise that I tend to <em>assume</em> that I have understood certain concepts, only to fail when explaining. Starting to write consistently would mean that I need to be capable in some form to put out my writings in a presentable manner. Since I would be blogging mostly, I feel it would be better to know HTML and CSS, instead of using a static site generator. This also ties in nicely with my second interest. </p>
    <p><strong>Indiehacking.</strong> I have a strong desire to FIRE, that means putting out products that would potentially generate revenue in order for me to achieve my goals. Indiehackers normally bootstrap their products mainly because the services are often catered towards niches and inorder to generate profits the cost/expensese must be low. This leads to a one person team running everything from building, testing, deploying to marketing. Being comfortable in HTML and CSS would enable me to be a better indiehacker. The second reason also ties in nicely with the third point.</p>
    <p><strong>Being able to ship things faster.</strong> I have got products out and I have realised that I am not playing to my strengths. The advantage of being an indiehacker is that I am not bogged down by hiearchy or beaucracy. I only serve the customer and no oneelse. Assuch I <em>should</em> be able to put out numerous iterations until I have a product that my customers truly love. That hasn't been my experience so far. I have been the bottle neck for a while now. I have outsourced my frontend work but when it comes to integrating the work with the framework(technical) I have used, I have been slothishly slow in implementing it. We procastinate the things that we <em>think</em> we aren't good at. Writing regularly, even only for my sake would enable me to parctise the fundamentals of frontend skill, while also enabling clarity in my thinking.</p>
