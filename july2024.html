	<h1>July, 2024</h1>
	<p>Dear wife,</p>
	<p>Happy Birthday. How fast does time fly! Only a moment ago I wrote to you to wish your birthday and now here I am, writing you another one. One year already.</p>
	<p>2023 was filled with love, adventure, laughter and learning. So many good and happy things to reminisce. We undertook our first venture where we brought Jaari to the big screen in Vue. I still remember the bright, warm summer day as we drove to the cinema to prepare the screening and welcome our guests. Our excitement as the guest arrived and the happiness of our customers evident on their faces after watching the movie in the cinema. Following that our trip to Nepal with our infant. Our apprehensions about how our little boy was going to cope the long haul flight. Our, especially your's overprepartaion in making sure that all of his needs would be taken care of inflight, packing the little one's sleep blanket as well as abundant inflight entertainment. Finally our trip to Singapore. Experencing 40 degrees days in Winter and limitless hawker centres. I feel truly blessed to have you and the little one in good health and have got to experience all these experiences together.</p>
	<p>I long for more of these trips, adventures and experiences together. Our recent trip to Croatia has made these beliefs and the desire more stronger. Not so much material accumulation but more life expereience and adventure. I truly feel blessed and rich. Rich in wealth, love, happiness and health. And our family is this source of strength and satifification, that enables me to keep going forward. To be able to experience these beautiful and inspiring moments with the people that truly matters in our life, while everyone is able and there.</p>
	<p>This new birth year brings in more opportunites to experience the good that life has to offer. I am looking forward to sharing the divine experience where we welcome our second child into our life and the world. To creating and running a business that is going to provide jobs and create hope and dreams of so many others. To enabling our kids to wanting to learn, explore and grow and to give their best in all they pursue.I want you beside me when we create these beautiful experiences. Happy Birthday</p>
	<p>Love Husband.</p>
