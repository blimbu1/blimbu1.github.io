	<h1>July, 2025</h1>
	<p>Dear wife,</p>
	<p>Happy Birthday. I have to tell you how surprised and delighted I was when I discovered that the last time I created an online post was your birthday letter for 2024. Surprised, because it was the last thing I have uploaded and genuinely delighted because I have an opportunity to tell you and the whole world, how I feel.</p>
	<p>Growing up is one thing and maturing is another. I am matured, now that I truly understand the significance of a loving and supportive partner. Someone who supports and loves unconditionally. I am really grateful to God that I have been blessed with you as my significant other. Your unconditional and unyielding love to me and our boys. Your devotion to being the best mother to our children and our desire to create the best environment for our children so that they can be able, strong young men, who make a positive contribution to the society. You and I are so in sync! Though our hearts beat separately they beat in the same rhythm. A lot of what makes me make you. We are both strong headed, independent and religious individuals, have the same morals and prioritise family and health in our life.<p>
	<p>You also do more than just be you. You enable me when I am extremely focused. Times when I am caught up in challenging or just mundane technical tasks, knowing that you are there waiting for me enables me to carry on and get things done. You being there with me when I am all excited in my vision; the fact the you are there for me to constantly share my vision and goals with and your support gives me the courage and determination to easily do and achieve which would otherwise be challenging.</p>
	<p>In this journey of life you also enable me to constantly learn and improve. The world especially in our day and age is constantly changing. New opportunites constantly come while some old opportunites disapper. I am now more inclined not to close my self to other opportunities, to explore opportunities together that could take us closer to our goals. We may be focused and self disciplined to follow our dreams, but are also agile and proactive when prospective wonderful opportunites come along our way.</p>
	<p>This is the state of life I am in. I am happy and grateful for everything that I have so far been blessed in life with. The time we have shared and the experience we have had so far, to expectantly looking forward to new and exciting experience still waiting for us. We are in this journey of life and I love it everyday that you are in the navigator seat with me while I am driving. While I am driving your beautiful, reliable red polo I am irrationally opitimistic that with you by my side, I will soon be driving the tesla of our dreams to not having to drive again.Happy Birthday once again.</p>
	<p>Love Husband.</p>
