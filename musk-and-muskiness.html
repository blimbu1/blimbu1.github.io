    <h1>Musk and his muskiness</h1>
    <p>Thursday, 9th March 2023</p>
    <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>. The man of the moment. The man of the hour, day month or infact the man of the century. You can never keep him out of the news. He is either firing his employees via twitter(<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64884287" target="_blank">bbc</a>) or bringing groundbreaking technology <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank"></a> to the masses. Because he is in the news for one reason or another, by default as an undescerning consumer of news he happens to to be in my thoughts as well.</p>
    <p>One such instance was today when I was listening to a rendition of Starman by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhP5oMzxDos" target="_blank">Sharon Van Etten</a>. I came across this music after watching his documentary on Netflix(The song was played in the ending credits). The documentary was about Spacex and how they have restarted to take astronauts back to ISS. I say <em>back</em> because prior to spacex USA/NASA had to use other countries launches to propel their astronauts into space. So spacex continuing human launches into space was a big milestone for USA after a backward step of disbanding the Shuttle program and not having anything in place to cover for it.</p>
    <p class="song">The song itself is only approximately a minute long and it starts at the chorus. For those not familiar with the song here is the lyrics</p>
    <ul class="lyrics">
      <li>There's a Starman waiting in the sky</li>
      <li>He'd like to come and meet us</li>
      <li>But he thinks he'd blow our minds</li>
      <li>There's a Starman waiting in the sky</li>
      <li>He's told us not to blow it</li>
      <li>'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile</li>
      <li>He told me</li>
      <li>Let the children lose it</li>
      <li>Let the children use it</li>
      <li>Let all the children boogie.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This song somehow resonated with me. For all he has been portrayed as (good and bad), Elon Musk is a nerdy guy who has been true to himself. Starting and building a single successful company takes a lot of effort and hardwork(I know because I have tried and am trying), let alone build three that are mega successfull. He hasn't achieved this by sheer luck either. Anyone familiar with his biography know that he's taken on massive risks, putting fortunes that an average person would probably take 10 lifetimes to earn, on the line. He is inspiring to me because for me he isn't motivated by wealth or luxury. He seems to love the hard challenges and the idea that the future can be now, bringing technologies only imagined and seen in movies to the present. Kind of like a starman, aware of all the possibilites, aware of what the future holds and to not give in now. To trust and believe that what we aim and works towards now will all be worthwhile.</p></body>
