	<h1>DECISIVENESS</h1>
	<p>Friday, 26th May 2023</p>
	<p>This is what I have learned so far about DECISIVENESS so far and this is how I am currently aligned to it. Views and experiences are my own.</p>
	<p><strong>Decisions need to be made</strong>. One of the things that I have done/been doing in the past is delaying making decision. The end outcome of this has been going past the time when a decision needs to be made so that it can be affective and landing at a point where a decision has been made by default. One of the reason why this seems to happen is the the desire for a complete picture or a better/complete view of the lay of the land, so as to be able to make the <u>perfect</u> decision. In reality this is hard to achieve. Decisions need to be made where most of the information is not available, and the lay of the land is always changing. The fixation and fear of making the <u>perfect</u> decision only puts you in a position where you end up not making any decisions and being passive.</p>
	<p>Other benefit of this is the development of decision muscle. The more decision that is made, the more it is trained to make better decisions quicker.</p>
	<p><strong>Decisions need to be made quick</strong>. Continuing from above. Just recently I was in a position where I had to rsvp to my friend's son 1st birthday and I was given 10 day's notice. The date coincided with my parents other events mainly puja and a wedding reception. A decision couldn't be made quickly as to weather I would be able to attend my friend's party, as the wedding reception was in a new/different location that my father wasn't confident driving to. I would potentially have to drive them there. In the end I the day before the event I decided on going to friend's party. The late decision making was one of the reason that stopped me considering other important factors with regards to the party and my son missing his first birthday party invite.</p>
	<p><strong>Be 100 percent behind the decision once its made.</strong> A famous quote that I love and use to center myself often is - <u>I <strong>may</strong> be wrong but never in doubt.</u> Sometimes you need to make a decision early on where the outcome or the implementation (of the decision) isn't until a while later. The later could be 3 hours, 2 days or a week. In these scenarios you will be tempted by various/many factors to relook/rethink the decision that has been made. In such scenarios it is important to hold still and hold strong.</p>
	<p><strong>Not all decisions are important.</strong>Ref 80/20. Not all decisions are important and can be made with a coin flip. The important point is decision needs to be made</p>
