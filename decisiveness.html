	<h1>DECISIVENESS</h1>
	<p>Friday, 26th May 2023</p>
	<p>This is what I have learned so far about DECISIVENESS and this is how I am currently aligned to it. I have come to realise DECISIVENESS is an important trait and am making a conscious effort in getting better at it.Views and experiences are my own.</p>
	<p><strong>Decisions need to be made</strong>. One of the things that I have done/been doing in the past is delaying making decision. The end outcome of this has been going past the time when a decision can be made and a decision has been made by default. One of the reason why this seems to happen is the the desire for a complete picture or a better/complete view of the lay of the land, so as to be able to make the <u>perfect</u> decision. Coupled with this is the <u>fear</u> of failure/rejection!</p>
	<p>Decisions and actions ususally need to be taken when most of the information is not available, and the lay of the land is always changing.Ultimately the fixation and fear of making the <u>perfect</u> decision is what has cost me countless opportunites. To negate this I have decided to adopt an 'intention' mindset instead of 'result fixation' mindset(no control over results). The intention is always to make the best decision at that <strong>instant in time</strong>(with what we know and have). Sometimes the decision works out and sometimes the lay of the land changes or the wind blows in a different direction.</p>
	<p>Other benefit of always making decision is the development of decision muscle. The more decision that is made, the more it is trained to make better decisions quicker. Making decisions involves more than just analysing numbers. It also involves intuition. These are the opportunites to hone one's intuition as well. </p>
	<p><strong>Decisions need to be made quick</strong>. Continuing from above. Just recently I was in a position where I had to rsvp to my friend's son 1st birthday party and I was given 10 day's notice. The date coincided with my parents other events, mainly puja and a wedding reception. A decision couldn't be made quickly as to weather I would be able to attend my friend's party, as the wedding reception was in a new/different location that my father wasn't confident driving to. I would potentially have to drive them there. In the end a day before the events I decided on going to friend's party. The late decision making stopped me considering other important factors with regards to the party and ultimately my son missing his first birthday party invite. In hindsight a decision made quickly and earlier would have enabled my son to attend his first birthday party invite as well as enabled me to consider other important factors relating to the event.</p>
	<p><strong>Be 100 percent behind the decision once its made.</strong> A famous quote that I love and use to center myself often is - <u>I <strong>may</strong> be wrong but never in doubt.</u> Sometimes you need to make a decision early on where the outcome or the implementation (of the decision) isn't until a while later. The later could be 3 hours, 2 days or a week. In these scenarios you will be tempted by various/many factors to relook/rethink the decision that has been made. In such scenarios it is important to hold still and hold strong.</p>
	<p><strong>Not all decisions are important.</strong>Ref 80/20. Not all decisions are important and can be made with a coin flip. The important point is decision needs to be made. Inversely you need to know which decisions are important and and get 100% behind it.</p>
	<p><strong>80/20/100/100</strong>.Referencing 80/20 again. Reading the book for the 5th? time and this has somehow resonated with me. Collect 80% of the information, in 20% of the time needed to make a decision. Make 100% of the decision and stand 100% behind the decisions made.</p>
