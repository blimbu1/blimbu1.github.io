	<h1>NEPAL VISIT 2024</h1>
	<p>Monday, 5th Feb 2023</p>
	<p>I want to write this while I am still feeling the holiday blues. Somehow, visit to Nepal always seems to do this to me. My heart's a little heavy, a little nostalgic and melancholic. Either words cannot describe exactly what/how I feel or alternatively the shortcomings are possibly on my part where I cannot put these emotins or thought on paper.</p>
