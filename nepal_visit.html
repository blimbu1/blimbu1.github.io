	<h1>NEPAL VISIT 2024</h1>
	<p>Monday, 5th Feb 2024</p>
	<p>I want to write this while I am still feeling the holiday blues. Somehow, visit to Nepal always seems to do this to me. My heart's a little heavy, a little nostalgic and melancholic. Either words cannot describe exactly what/how I feel or alternatively the shortcomings are possibly on my part where I cannot put these emotins or thought on paper.</p>
	<p>January of 2024 seemed a perfect time to plan this journey. My grandmother had been on the mend since her major operation (removal of duodenum) and with her having cancer as well this was one of the last few opportunities to introduce her and my grandfather to her granddaughter-in-law and her great grand son. We flew on the 29th of Dec and arrived at Kathmandu on the 30th of Dec, 2023. Being first time parents our major concerns were how best we could make our little toddler (21 months at time of travel) comfortable on this long international flight. We researched what was allowed, what was needed and also did prep such as packing inflight entertainment and food for our little one. Sometimes or most often than not, the limitations and weakness are in parents than in the little ones. Such was the case this time round as well. We felt that maybe the compact plane cabin and a journey time of 15hours would be quite hard on him.I had feared that he could potentially be cranky and as a result be a nuisance in the flight. However in reality though,he was a perfect travel companion. Though he didn't sleep a lot in the flight, he didn't create a ruckus at all. He was curious and energetic as he usually is, taking in the new environment of the plane cabin, tinkering with the inflight entertainment system which was a novelty to him and even managing a quick nap in the congested plane seat.The other traveller were none the wiser that a toddler was blissfully travelling with them.</p>
