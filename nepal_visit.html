	<h1>NEPAL VISIT 2024</h1>
	<p>Monday, 5th Feb 2024</p>
	<p>I want to write this while I am still feeling the holiday blues. Somehow, a visit to Nepal always seems to do this to me. My heart's a little heavy, a little nostalgic and melancholic. Either words cannot describe exactly what/how I feel or alternatively the shortcomings are possibly on my part where I cannot put these emotins or thought properly on paper.</p>
	<p>January of 2024 seemed a perfect time to carry out this journey. My grandmother had been on the mend since her major operation (removal of duodenum) and with her having cancer as well this was one of the last few opportunities to introduce her and my grandfather to their granddaughter-in-law and their great grand son. We flew on the 29th of Dec and arrived at Kathmandu on the 30th of Dec, 2023. Being first time parents our major concerns were how best we could make our little toddler (21 months at time of travel) comfortable on this long international flight. We researched what was allowed, what was needed and also did prep such as packing inflight entertainment and food for our little one. Sometimes or most often than not, the limitations and weakness are in parent's mind than in the little ones. Such was the case this time round as well. We felt that maybe the compact plane cabin and a journey time of 15hours would be quite hard on him.I had feared that he could potentially be cranky and as a result be a nuisance in the flight. However in reality though,he was a perfect travel companion. Though he didn't sleep a lot in the flight, he didn't create a ruckus at all. He was curious and energetic as he usually is, taking in the new environment of the plane cabin, tinkering with the inflight entertainment system which was a novelty to him and even managing a quick nap in the congested plane seat.The other traveller were none the wiser that a toddler was blissfully travelling with them.</p>
	<p>Landing at Tribhuvan International Airport is different to landing at any other world class airport. One difference is the visibility of residentail homes from the airport tarmac. This wouldn't be possible at a "world class airport". The other is the infrastructure, mostly the absence of bays for the plane and the passengers for each landed aeroplane having to be transported a short distance by the bus. This however is home to me. Walking down the plane stairs, onto the tarmac taking in the warm and dusty air of Kathmandu. My holiday had really begun.</p>
	<p>I enjoy and love being in Nepal. There is that stillness and peacefulness that settles in me. The energy, the people and the vibe hits different. The first day back at KTM, my son and I met and mingled with a lot of my wife's family. There was love, laughter and even cake. So much excitement and energy in the air. The following days were subsequently spent meeting more of my wife's family, travelling around Kathmandu and enjoying more good food including celebrating New Year's with my inlaws in this lovely resturant called Tama.(For me atleast their fokso is to die for) A quick visit to Kaka's to introduce my wife to him and five days had already passed. It was time to fly to Biratnagar for my wife and son to meet my grandparents</p>
	<p>The day of the domestic flight to Biratnagar, I didn't sleep very well. I could feel something was coming and this was attested by multiple visit in quick succession to the lavatory after waking up. It was still morning(Thursday) and speaking to my wife, she let me know that she wasn't feeling too great either. She and I both had diarrahoea, something I am told is a rite of passage when visiting Nepal from a developed country. I had been feeling pretty good and healthy for the five days I had been there and so I put the diarrahoea down to the steamed buns I had on our tour of Boudha Stupa. Nonetheless there was no time to rest and recuperate. My in-laws would be travelling with us to Dharan and further on with my wife to Pathivara.</p>
	<p>Like how landing from a "world class airport" to Kathmandu feels different, landing at Biratnagar from Ktm also feels different. This could be due to ktm being at a much higher altitude and geographical location, but walking on the tarmac of the airport towards arrival you can certainly feel the warmth of the tarai. 24 degrees Celsius and bright sunshine was announced at landing. Wearing a green hoodie felt a bit inappropriate. At the airport my brother-in-law(Arjun jwai) had come to pick us up. Still feeling a little weak having not eaten anything due to the diarrahoea, we loaded all of our luggage onto the maruti van and made our way to Dharan. Driving from Biratnagar to Dharan from the airport felt like pure freedom. The highway in Biratnagar has been much improved, four lane both ways and there is no congestion like in ktm. Sitting in the navigator seat, taking in the changing landscape of the tarai from green fields dotted with buildings adorned with advertisement, crowded and busy marketplace bustling with people, bicycle, vans to small out-of-place bridges and finally to the tinkune forest.I didn't mind my illness so much as inside I was all happy, excited and at peace to be at the home I grew up.</p>
	<p>I was full of excitment as we made our way through the streets of Dharan and finally rolled infront of my Dharan home. I was weak and dehydrated but I was home. This was my first visit back since mom had added a storey to the house and god rid of the corrugated tin roof. I took in the new look of the house and sat on the bench outside of our outdoor dining/kitchen, that has been a mainstay of our home(been there ever since I can remember). My grandfather and grandmother (who looked frail but still same to how she has always looked to me) put tika on us, fed us curd(a good symbol) and draped my wife in a shawl as a symbol of entering the family home for the first time. We then entered through the main door which had small copper ghagri and flowers on each side(for auspicous occasion)put our bags away, dhoging my grandparents with money and gift that we had brought and got our Dharan stay underway.</p>
	<p>Dharan. A town that I love. A town that I grew up in. The place where my formative development happened. The town that has provided me unconditioned love and novel experiences. Memories and feelings created that I will hold, cherish and keep in times of good and bad. Memories of me and my friends raiding our little orchard and our neighbour's orchard for litchies, guavas and cherries. Memories of playing marbles and khopee on the dirt road infront of my home before it was tarmacd. Evenings spent playing football on the street till it got dark and last goal wins rule came into play. Chilly winter evenings spent creating fire in the concrete waste bins and standing around it with neighbours and friends. Memories of time, so simple, cheerful and one so pure.</p>
	<p>Life in Dharan is idyllic, slow and peaceful. There is none of that energy,bustle and crowd that can be seen in the streets of Asan in Kathmandu. My aim and goals for my time in Dharan were simple. To get myself and my son to spend as much time as possible with my grandparents. To visit the temples in Dharan, which I hadn't done the last time round. And also to catch up with my cousins especially with my Jetha Mama's sons. I had arranged a week's worth of remote working, so that I could prolong my stay and this was carried out while I was in Dharan. In the morning I spent time with my grandparents, my sister, my cousins and my toddler. In the evenings I spent time in my makeshift living room office. A vivid image that comes to my mind is my boy using his great grandmother's stick which was much taller than him, to walk around the varandah, imitating his grandmother. The day was warm and bright, and this was around late morning when we were all sat gathered around the verandah. I can still picture that smile on her face, her eyes glowing with happiness as my little one strutted about unevenly. Other memory is my little boy sitting next to his great grandmother in the front verandah on plastic outdoor chairs. My grandmother peeling oranges and feeding it to my son and she being earnestly surprised when he ended up eating close to three oranges by himself. The joy, happiness and surprise in her face. Time passes by quickly when you are at peace and are having fun. The warm orange glow of the late afternoon sun, the time spent on the newly built balcony munching on almost ripe guavas and looking at people walking up or down the street, the afternoon tea paired with puff, nights after work spent chatting to my sister about mundane topics. No sooner had we landed, We were done with our vhet ghat program, it was time to roll up the mattresses and the duvet and it was time to say goodbye. We returned to Kathmandu via the long winded Sindhuli way!</p>
	<p>These are only fragments and snippets of what I experienced this holiday. Looking back, and writing this conclusion on 28/02/24 (25 days after landing back in UK), there are still feelings and emotions simmering in me. Time when I spent a day talking to my cousin and exploring the area around her house in Mahalaxmi and a time when my wife and I took the public bus to Tripureshwor to purchase Titaura. </p>
