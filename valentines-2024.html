	<h1>Valentines, 2024</h1>
	<p>Dear wife,</p>
	<p>Happy Valentines Day. I was debating whether to write this letter in paper. As you are reading it online, being online has won that debate. Atleast this way you will not have to safekeep this letter. This letter from me to you will always be there. The added benefit being if they desire, the whole world can see my love for you at this point in time and make grammatical corrections if necessary.</p>
	<p>Looking at it rationally, I have never understood why we(people) need valentine's day to profess our love. I could even side with the idea that this particular day has been created by the captialists to encourage the masses into spending. After all the calendar does look pretty sparse after New Year's and before Easters! Discussions aside, with regards to Valentine's Day origin, I am grateful that this particular day makes me make a little extra effort to show my love. After all it is not so easy to write, so as to say that I love you. And here it is in written in words, that I love you.</p>
	<p>I have been looking into various reasoning as to why time seems to be speeding the older we get. Maybe it is due to the numerous worldly obligations that we get encumbered with. Or maybe it is due the fact that a year only accounts for a small percentage of the total time we have been on Earth, when we are older. One other theory is that time speeds up when we are having fun. On this ride that you and I haven been on the last eight years or so, that certainly is the case. Since we have been married, time, different scenario and life just feels like a blur. The only constant in those moments being we being continously together. Body, mind and soul moulded into one since our religious marraige ritual. Together hand in hand, whatever tempest blows outside or across tranquil ocean under clear moonlit sky.</p>
	<p>As the occassion demands, I must quote from a poet that I have recently come across. It reads something like this.</p>
	<ul class="lyrics">
	  <li>"There are different wells within your heart.</li>
	  <li>Some fill with each good rain,</li>
	  <li>Others are far too deep for that.</br></br></li>
	  <li>In one well</li>
	  <li>You have just a few precious cups of water,</li>
	  <li>That "love" is literally something of yourself,</li>
	  <li>It can grow as slow as a diamond</li>
	  <li>If it is lost.</br></br></li>
	  <li>Your love</li>
	  <li>Should never be offered to the mouth of a</li>
	  <li>Stranger,</li>
	  <li>Only to someone</li>
	  <li>Who has the valor and daring</li>
	  <li>To cut pieces of their soul off with a knife</li>
	  <li>Then weave them into a blanket</li>
	  <li>To protect you.</br></br></li>
	  <li>There are different wells within us.</li>
	  <li>Some fill with each good rain,</li>
	  <li>Others are far, far too deep</li>
	  <li>For that."</br></br></li>
	  <li><strong>-Hafez</strong></br></li>
	</ul>
	<p>And to you my love, I have offered some of the few precious cups of water. And for you my love I am ready to shred my soul.</p>
