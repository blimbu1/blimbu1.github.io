	<h1>APRIL, 2024</h1>
	<p>Monday, 22nd of April,2024</p>
	<p>Hello young Binay.</p>
	<p>Hope you are doing fine. I believe you are fine as you are an exceptionally strong individual. Without you I wouldn't be here, where I am. It is your strong self-discipline, your ability to persevere, not wavering from your goal and your resilience that has enabled me to experience the life I have always wanted. I am now engulfed in abundance of wealth, surrounded with more money in my life than you have imagined. It is your courage to pursue your dreams and listen to yourself, even when things were not going as expected, that has enabled me to enjoy this freedom.</p>
	<p>Life now is more fulfilling. There is so much more freedom. Freedom as to how I spend my time and the work that I do. The majority of my latter years have been spent living in and exploring new places and experiencing different climate and cultures. Sea fishing in the Bahamas (turqoise warm waters and plenty of little islands with soft white sand to moor off of and relax), experiencing Mauritius and travelling to North India (The journey to ladakh and the whole experience in the himalayas is surreal) and Delhi, has been some of the highlights. The views, the feelings and the experience has forever been etched in my soul.</p>
	<p>You are doing great Binay. You are really close to where you have always wanted to be. My present, your future is abundant with wealth, happiness and freedom. </p>
